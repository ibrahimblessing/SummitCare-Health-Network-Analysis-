# SummitCare Health Network-Analysis

## Project Background
SummitCare Health Network is a growing chain of hospitals and clinics committed to providing top-quality, patient-centered care. As part of their efforts to modernize operations, the organization recently centralized its data, bringing together patient records, treatments, admissions, and financial details into one digital system.

While this was a big step forward, the leadership team quickly realized that having access to more data did not automatically lead to better decisions. They were overwhelmed by the volume of information and needed help turning it into something useful.

That is where I came in. As a Data Analyst, my role was to look  into the hospitalâ€™s dataset, clean and organize the information, and use Power BI to uncover insights that could guide better decisions. From understanding patient demographics and medical conditions to analyzing doctor performance and hospital finances, my goal was to help the SummitCare team see the story behind the numbers and use it to improve care and operations.

## Objectives
- Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, blood type)
- Explore common medical conditions and medication.
- Monitor doctor performance
- Track types of hospital admissions
- Analyze insurance coverage
- Evaluate financial performance and revenue trends
- Understand health test outcomes
